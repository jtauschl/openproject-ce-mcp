# Security Policy

## Supported versions

This project follows semantic versioning. Security fixes are released against the
latest published version on PyPI. Only the most recent release line is supported;
please upgrade before reporting an issue you cannot reproduce on the latest
version.

| Version         | Supported |
| --------------- | --------- |
| Latest release  | ✅        |
| Older releases  | ❌        |

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue for security-sensitive reports.

Instead, report privately via GitHub's
[**Report a vulnerability**](https://github.com/jtauschl/openproject-ce-mcp/security/advisories/new)
form (Security → Advisories). If you cannot use that form, email the maintainer
at the address on the [GitHub profile](https://github.com/jtauschl).

When reporting, please include:

- the affected version (`openproject-ce-mcp --version`),
- a description of the issue and its impact,
- steps to reproduce or a proof of concept, and
- any relevant configuration (with **secrets redacted** — never send real API
  tokens).

You can expect an initial acknowledgement within a few days. Once a fix is
available it will be released to PyPI and noted in the
[CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) under a **Security** heading, as with the fixes in
0.2.2.

## Security model

This server is a guarded bridge to the OpenProject REST API. Its security posture
depends on configuration; the most relevant controls are:

- **Read/write are disabled by default** and enabled per resource scope via
  `OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_*` flags. The global read flag is a master kill-switch
  (AND-semantics); write scopes are always intersected with read scope, so a
  project must be readable before it can be written.
- **Project allowlists** (`OPENPROJECT_ALLOWED_PROJECTS_READ` /
  `_WRITE`) restrict every operation to the named projects.
- **Admin writes** (user/group/membership management) require the separate
  `OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_ADMIN_WRITE` opt-in.
- **Write operations use a preview/confirm flow** by default; self-scoped
  mutations (your own notifications, preferences, emoji reactions) execute
  directly.
- **The API token is a secret.** Store it only in a local, git-ignored config
  (e.g. `.mcp.json`, mode `600`) — never commit it. A remote plain-`http://`
  base URL emits a startup warning because the token would be sent unencrypted.

See the README's configuration and security sections for the full flag reference.
