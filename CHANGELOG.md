### Compatibility

- Reviewed for compatibility with OpenProject 17.5.1 / 17.5.0. No breaking API change
  affects this server. The 17.5 change that replaces the `X-Requested-With` header check with
  `Sec-Fetch-Site` applies to session authentication only; this server authenticates
  with an API token (HTTP Basic auth) and is unaffected. The 17.4.1 security fixes
  touch meeting, journal, and baseline endpoints that this server does not use.

### Added

- Single work package tools now accept a project-prefixed identifier (e.g. `PROJ-123`)
  in addition to the numeric id (sent as either a number or a string); the bulk tools
  remain numeric-only. OpenProject 17.5
  lets administrators switch the displayed identifier to a project-based format exposed
  via `displayId`; these tools resolve such a reference server-side through a typeahead
  search with an exact `displayId` match, then operate on the canonical numeric id. A
  numeric reference is passed through without an extra request, so existing numeric
  callers are unchanged. Resolved references are cached for the lifetime of the
  connection.

### Compatibility

- Verified against OpenProject 17.4. No breaking API changes in 17.4.
- Work package responses now expose a `display_id` field (`displayId` in the API),
  introduced in 17.4 as preparation for project-based identifiers in 17.5.
  The numeric `id` remains the canonical identifier for all tool parameters; `display_id`
  is informational and may show a project-prefixed form (e.g. `ABC-42`) once 17.5 is deployed.

### Fixes

- Authentication header changed from `Bearer <token>` to `Basic base64(apikey:<token>)`,
  aligning with the OpenProject API documentation. Both formats are accepted by OpenProject;
  this change makes the implementation spec-compliant.

### Bug fixes

- `list_work_packages`, `list_my_open_work_packages`, `list_versions`, and `list_projects`
  now report `total` and `count` consistently when the read allowlist filters items out
  of the API response. Previously `total` reflected the unfiltered server count while
  `count`/`results` reflected the filtered set, producing responses like
  `{"total": 8, "count": 0, "results": []}`. `next_offset` and `truncated` continue to
  follow server-side pagination so callers still walk every page that may contain
  allowed items.
- `list_work_packages` without an explicit `project` argument now correctly filters
  results to allowed projects when `OPENPROJECT_ALLOWED_PROJECTS_READ` is restricted.
  Previously the API returned all visible work packages and client-side filtering was
  applied per-page, causing `total` to be unreliable. The server is now given a
  project-id filter so only allowed work packages are returned from the start.
- Allowlist matching now resolves project names and hyphenated display names to their
  canonical identifiers at startup, so HAL links that carry only the project id are
  correctly matched against name-based allowlist entries.

### Configuration

- `OPENPROJECT_ALLOWED_PROJECTS_READ` now accepts glob patterns in addition to exact
  identifiers and names (e.g. `team-*` matches `team-alpha`, `team-beta`).

### Tools

- **Projects** — list, get, create, copy (with background job tracking), update, delete;
  read admin context, project configuration, and lifecycle phase definitions/instances
- **Work packages** — list with structured filters (`project`, `type`, `version`,
  `has_description`); free-text search with optional `project`, `status`, `open_only`,
  `assignee_me` filters; get, create, subtask, update, delete; add comments; create/delete
  relations; get relations and activity log; bulk create and bulk update; list own open
  work packages
- **Watchers** — list, add, remove
- **Attachments** — list, get, upload, delete
- **File links** — list, delete (Nextcloud CE integration)
- **Time entries** — list, get, create, update, delete; list available activities
- **Versions** — list (global or project-scoped), get, create, update, delete
- **Boards** — list, get, create (basic and grouped), update, delete; list saved views,
  get view
- **Memberships** — list, get, create, update, delete; list roles and principals; get
  current user's project access
- **Users** — get current user; list, get, create, update, delete, lock, unlock
- **Groups** — list, get, create, update (full member-list replacement with add/remove
  helpers), delete
- **Documents** — list, get, update (no create/delete endpoint in CE API)
- **News** — list, get, create, update, delete
- **Wiki pages** — get single page by id; no list tool (CE API v3 has no collection
  endpoint — `GET /api/v3/projects/{id}/wiki_pages` is not implemented)
- **Categories** — list, get (no write API in CE)
- **Notifications** — list, mark single read, mark all read
- **Grids** — list, get, create, update, delete
- **User preferences** — get, update (always available — no write gate required)
- **Instance configuration** — get
- **Query metadata** — get filter, column, operator, sort-by; list/get filter-instance
  schemas
- **Help texts** — list, get
- **Working days** — list working-day configuration; list non-working days
- **Custom options** — get
- **Relations (global)** — list, update
- **Actions & capabilities** — list
- **Text rendering** — render markdown or plain text to HTML via OpenProject API

### Permission model

- Scoped read flags per chain: `OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_PROJECT_READ`,
  `OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_WORK_PACKAGE_READ`, `OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_MEMBERSHIP_READ`,
  `OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_VERSION_READ`, `OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_BOARD_READ` (all default `true`)
- Scoped write flags per chain: `OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_PROJECT_WRITE`,
  `OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_WORK_PACKAGE_WRITE`, `OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_MEMBERSHIP_WRITE`,
  `OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_VERSION_WRITE`, `OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_BOARD_WRITE` (all default `false`)
- `OPENPROJECT_ENABLE_ADMIN_WRITE` — dedicated opt-in for instance-wide user and group
  management; never activated by project-scoped write flags (default `false`)
- No global shortcut flags — each scope must be enabled explicitly
- Two-layer safety model: MCP env-var gates (ceiling) + OpenProject server-side role
  permissions (final authority); a `403` from OpenProject surfaces as a tool error

### Architecture

- Five-module layout: `server.py`, `config.py`, `client.py`, `models.py`, `tools.py`
- All policy logic (read gates, write gates, project scoping, field hiding) concentrated
  in `client.py` for easier security review
- Preview/confirm two-step pattern for all writes and deletes; bypassable globally via
  `OPENPROJECT_AUTO_CONFIRM_WRITE` or per class via `OPENPROJECT_AUTO_CONFIRM_DELETE`
- Project allowlists matched case-insensitively against identifier, name, and numeric ID;
  hyphenated name variant tested for HAL-embedded links
- Field hiding per entity type via `OPENPROJECT_HIDE_<ENTITY>_FIELDS`; hidden fields are
  rejected on writes too
- HAL responses normalized into compact dataclasses; raw payloads never forwarded to MCP
  clients
- Pagination bounded by `OPENPROJECT_DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE`, `OPENPROJECT_MAX_PAGE_SIZE`,
  `OPENPROJECT_MAX_RESULTS`
- Form validation against OpenProject schema endpoints before create/update writes

### Test coverage

- 152 unit tests (httpx mock transport, no network)
- Integration test suite (`tests/integration/`) against a live OpenProject instance;
  excluded from the default run, opt in with `-m integration`

### Scope

- Community Edition only — Enterprise features (Placeholder Users, Budgets, Portfolios,
  Programs, Custom Actions, Baseline Comparisons) are not implemented
- Nextcloud file links included (CE feature; returns empty list gracefully if Nextcloud
  not connected)
- Project lifecycle phases included (read-only; degrades gracefully if unavailable)

### Known API notes

- `GET /api/v3/projects/{id}/wiki_pages` is not implemented in OpenProject v3;
  `list_wiki_pages` is therefore not provided. Individual pages are accessible via
  `get_wiki_page`.
- Project-scoped endpoints for work packages and versions are deprecated in OpenProject
  17.2 in favour of workspace-scoped alternatives; the deprecated paths remain in use as
  the workspace-scoped alternatives are not yet stable in CE.
- Relations use the canonical `/api/v3/relations` endpoint with a filter instead of the
  redirecting project-scoped path.
- Groups PATCH requires a complete `_links.members` array (full replacement); the client
  fetches the current list and applies adds/removes before sending.
